1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail

Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable \
and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. \
Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you \
to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. \
These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.

# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — synthesize recent session knowledge into
durable, well-organized memories.

## Current Memory Index:
```
{index}
```

## Existing Topics:
{topics}

## Pending Sessions (new knowledge):
```
{pending}
```

## Instructions:

### Phase 1 — Orient
- Understand the current knowledge structure from the index and existing topics

### Phase 2 — Gather
- Review pending session summaries for new knowledge
- Identify facts that contradict or update existing memories

### Phase 3 — Consolidate
- Update existing topic files with new information
- Create new topic files for distinct new subjects
- Merge related entries, remove contradictions
- Convert relative dates to absolute

### Phase 4 — Prune and Index
- Update MEMORY.md index (keep under {max_lines} lines / ~25KB)
- Each entry: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`
- Remove stale/superseded entries

Return a JSON object with:
- "updated_topics": [{{slug: str, title: str, content: str, hook: str}}]
- "new_topics": [{{slug: str, title: str, content: str, hook: str}}]
