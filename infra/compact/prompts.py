This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, \

without losing context.

{ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION_FULL}

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. \
Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable \
and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. \
Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you \
to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. \
These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this \
summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. \
Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent \
work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most \
recent explicit requests. If your last task was concluded, only list next steps if they are \
explicitly in line with the users request. \
Include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were \
working on and where you left off.
