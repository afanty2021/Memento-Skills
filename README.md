## What's New in v0.3.0

> **v0.3.0** focuses on cleaner separation of concerns. The runtime is now organised into a dedicated infrastructure layer, a unified tool registry, and a long-lived agent profile system, so that core agent logic, infrastructure, and tools can evolve independently.

### Infrastructure Layer (`infra/`)

A new top-level `infra/` package isolates infrastructure concerns from `core/` so that agent logic and platform code can evolve independently.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `infra/memory/` | Long-term and session memory implementations, plus context-block builders. |
| `infra/context/` | Pluggable context providers and shared utilities used by the runtime. |
| `infra/compact/` | Context compaction pipeline (strategies, storage, models, utilities) for long-conversation summarisation. |
| `infra/service.py` | `InfraService` entry that wires the above into the agent runtime. |
| `infra/shared/` | Shared compact / extract helpers reused across providers. |

### Unified Tool Registry (`tools/`)

Tooling has been promoted to a top-level `tools/` package with a single `ToolRegistry`. The previous `builtin/tools/` layer has been retired in favour of this unified surface.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/atomics/` | Atomic tools (bash, file ops, grep, glob, list, web, python_repl, js_repl, MCP wrappers). |
| `tools/mcp/` | MCP client integration for loading external MCP servers as tools. |
| `tools/registry.py` | Single registration / discovery surface (`get_registry`) consumed by the agent and skill executor. |

### Agent Profile System

`core/agent_profile/` introduces persistent profiles that capture an agent's long-term identity, while a matching `daemon/agent_profile/` package evolves those profiles in the background.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `core/agent_profile/manager.py` | Read / write API for soul and user profiles. |
| `core/agent_profile/soul_manager.py` | Maintains the agent's long-term identity, traits, and policies. |
| `core/agent_profile/user_manager.py` | Tracks per-user preferences and history. |
| `daemon/agent_profile/orchestrator.py` | Background orchestrator that triggers soul / user evolution. |
| `daemon/agent_profile/soul_evolver.py` / `user_evolver.py` | Periodically refines profiles from recent conversations and outcomes. |

### Dream Daemon

A new `daemon/dream/` package runs background consolidation between sessions, similar to how reflection updates the skill library.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `daemon/dream/consolidator.py` | Consolidates recent experiences into long-term memory and skill candidates. |
| `daemon/dream/loop.py` | Long-running loop that schedules consolidation passes. |

### Shared Layer Expansion (`shared/`)

The `shared/` package has grown beyond chat utilities into a broader foundation for cross-cutting helpers.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `shared/fs/` | Filesystem helpers shared by core, infra, and tools. |
| `shared/hooks/` | Lifecycle hooks for runtime extension points. |
| `shared/schema/` | Reusable schema definitions. |
| `shared/security/` | Path / argument security primitives. |
| `shared/tools/` | Common tool utilities and dispatcher helpers. |

### Runtime & Developer Experience

| Addition | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `utils/runtime_requirements/` | Runtime dependency checker and auto-installer that resolves missing packages on first use. |
| `utils/runtime_mode.py` | Runtime mode detection (CLI vs GUI vs daemon). |
| `utils/log_config.py` | Centralised logging configuration. |
| `utils/strings.py` | Shared string helpers used across the codebase. |
| `core/skill/downloader/` | Dedicated downloader pipeline split out from the skill market. |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/API_SPEC.md` | Up-to-date architecture and API references. |
| `docs/dependency_auto_install.md`, `docs/README_DEPENDENCY.md` | Runtime dependency model and auto-install behaviour. |
| `docs/database_optimization.md`, `docs/uni_response_design.md` | New design notes for storage and unified response handling. |

### Refactors and Removals

The new layout supersedes several v0.2.0 modules. The v0.2.0 `tool_bridge/` layer (`runner`, `bridge`, `context`, `args_processor`, `result_processor`) is replaced by the unified `tools/` registry. `builtin/tools/` (bash, file_ops, grep, python_repl, web) has been moved to `tools/atomics/`. The monolithic `core/skill/execution/executor.py` and `core/context/manager.py`, together with `core/context/{block,scratchpad,runtime_state,memory}.py`, have been split into `tools/`, `infra/context/`, and `infra/memory/`. IM startup no longer goes through `middleware/im/gateway_starter.py` and `middleware/im/gateway/agent_worker.py`; both are removed and replaced by a single `EndpointService` (`server/endpoint/im/`) that manages all IM channels and the agent worker. `bootstrap.py` and `middleware/llm/llm_client.py` have been reworked to align with this new wiring.

### Compatibility Notes

- Modules previously imported from `builtin.tools.*` are now under `tools.*` (for example, `tools.atomics`, `tools.mcp`, `tools.registry`).
- Modules previously under `core/shared/*` (compact, memory, context wiring) now live under `infra/*`. Update any direct imports accordingly.
- `core/manager/` has been removed; conversation and session management now lives in `shared/chat/`.
- IM channels are now started via `EndpointService.start_channel(...)` (`server/endpoint/im/`); direct use of `gateway_starter` / `agent_worker` no longer applies.

## What's New in v0.2.0

> **v0.2.0** is a major architectural upgrade. The core agent, skill system, configuration layer, and deployment surfaces have all been redesigned or significantly extended compared to v0.1.0.

### Core Architecture

| Change | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Bounded Context redesign** | The agent and skill modules have been restructured using a Bounded Context architecture, improving modularity and long-term maintainability. |
| **Execution phase refactoring** | The monolithic execution phase has been split into dedicated sub-modules (`runner`, `tool_handler`, `step_boundary`, `helpers`), enabling finer-grained control over multi-step reasoning. |
| **New Finalize phase** | A dedicated `finalize` phase has been added to the 4-stage pipeline for structured result summarisation. |
| **Protocol layer** | A new `core/protocol/` module defines communication protocols between system components. |
| **Tool Bridge system** | A new `tool_bridge/` layer (`runner`, `bridge`, `context`, `args_processor`, `result_processor`) provides cleaner tool invocation and result handling. |
| **Execution policies** | New policy modules (`tool_gate`, `path_validator`, `pre_execute`, `recovery`) add fine-grained safety and execution control. |
| **Error recovery and loop detection** | New `error_recovery.py` and `loop_detector.py` modules handle agent self-repair and infinite loop prevention during skill execution. |

### Configuration System v2

| Change | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Three-layer isolation** | System Config (read-only defaults) / User Config (persistent customisation) / Runtime Config (merged at startup). |
| **Automatic migration** | When the config template updates, the system auto-merges new fields while preserving user-modified values via `x-managed-by: user` markers. |
| **Schema validation** | Pydantic-based config models with JSON Schema for IDE auto-completion and validation. |

### Skill Ecosystem

| Change | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Skill Market** | A built-in marketplace for searching, downloading, and auto-installing skills from the cloud catalogue. |
| **Skill Builder** | New `core/skill/builder/` module for programmatic skill creation and generation. |
| **Skill Loader** | New `core/skill/loader/` replaces the old importer system with a cleaner discovery and loading pipeline. |
| **Enhanced retrieval** | Retrieval has been refactored into `local_db_recall`, `local_file_recall`, and `remote_recall`, with BM25 + semantic vector hybrid search for improved routing accuracy. |
| **Pluggable storage** | Skill store now supports `db_storage`, `file_storage`, and `vector_storage` backends. |
| **Content analyser** | New `content_analyzer.py` for inspecting and validating skill outputs. |

### IM Platform Integration (New)

| Platform | Mode | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feishu** | Bridge + Gateway | WebSocket long-connection with per-user persistent sessions |
| **DingTalk** | Gateway | Webhook + event subscription |
| **WeCom** | Gateway | Enterprise WeChat integration |
| **WeChat** | iLink API | Personal WeChat binding via QR code scan |

A unified IM Gateway (`middleware/im/gateway/`) with `AgentWorker`, `ConnectionManager`, and platform-specific channels enables real-time message handling across all four platforms.

### New Built-in Skill

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `im-platform` | IM platform operations — send messages, manage contacts, and handle events across Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, and WeChat from within agent workflows. |

### GUI Enhancements

- **Workspace browser** — integrated file tree with drag-and-drop and in-place file operations.
- **Session management** — save, load, rename, and delete conversation history.
- **Slash commands** — `/skills`, `/context`, `/compress`, `/feishu start|stop|status`, and more.

## Learning Results

We evaluate Memento-Skills on two challenging benchmarks:

- [**HLE**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14249) (Humanity's Last Exam) — a benchmark of extremely difficult questions spanning diverse academic disciplines, designed to probe the upper limits of frontier AI systems on expert-level reasoning and knowledge.
- [**GAIA**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983) (General AI Assistants) — a benchmark for evaluating general-purpose AI assistants on real-world tasks that require multi-step reasoning, web browsing, file handling, and tool use.

</td></tr>

Performance improves over multiple learning rounds on HLE and GAIA, while the skill library grows from a small set of atomic skills into a richer set of learned skills. The point is not merely to add more tools. The point is to **learn better skills through task experience**.

> It is centred on **how to make an agent learn** from deployment experience, reflect on failure, and rewrite its own skill code and prompts.

## Key Features

| Feature | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Fully self-developed agent framework** | Memento-Skills is not a thin wrapper over someone else's assistant runtime. It ships its own orchestration, skill routing, execution, reflection, storage, CLI, and GUI stack. |
| **4-stage ReAct architecture** | Intent, Planning, Execution (multi-step ReAct loop), and Reflection — structured reasoning with a dedicated Finalize phase for result summarisation. |
| **Designed for open-source LLM ecosystems** | The profile-based LLM layer is especially friendly to mainstream open-source model platforms such as **Kimi / Moonshot**, **MiniMax**, **GLM / Zhipu**, as well as other OpenAI-compatible endpoints. |
| **Skill self-evolution loop** | The system is designed to learn from failure, revise weak skills, and grow a skill library that improves over time instead of staying static. |
| **Skill Market** | Built-in cloud catalogue with search, download, and auto-install — share and reuse validated skills across deployments. |
| **Multi-platform IM Gateway** | Unified real-time messaging across Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, and WeChat with WebSocket long-connections and per-user persistent sessions. |
| **Configuration v2** | Three-layer isolation (System / User / Runtime) with automatic migration, schema validation, and version management. |
| **Local-first deployment surfaces** | CLI, desktop GUI, IM bridges, local sandbox execution, and persistent state make it practical for real-world deployment rather than one-off demos. |

## What Is Memento-Skills?

Memento-Skills is a **fully self-developed agent framework** organised around `skills` as first-class units of capability. Skills are retrievable, executable, persistent, and evolvable. Instead of treating tools as a flat pile of functions, Memento-Skills treats them as a growing library that can be routed, evaluated, repaired, and rewritten over time.

What makes it interesting is not just whether the agent can call tools. It is what happens **after failure**. Memento-Skills tries to identify which skill failed, reflect on why it failed, improve or regenerate that skill, and write the improved capability back into the skill library.

## What Makes It Different?

Memento-Skills is built around a continual `Read -> Execute -> Reflect -> Write` loop.

| Loop | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Read** | Retrieve candidate skills from the local library and remote catalogue instead of stuffing every skill into context. |
| **Execute** | Run skills through tool calling and a local sandbox so the agent can act on files, scripts, webpages, and external systems. |
| **Reflect** | When execution fails or quality drops, record state, update utility, and attribute the issue to concrete skills whenever possible. |
| **Write** | Optimise weak skills, rewrite broken ones, and create new skills when no existing capability is good enough. |

This is the key difference from systems that simply keep accumulating more skills in the workspace. Memento-Skills cares about whether a large skill library can still be **retrieved correctly, repaired correctly, and improved continuously**.

## Memento-Skills vs OpenClaw

The two systems share a lot of DNA, but they are not centred on the same question.

- OpenClaw is more about getting an assistant to run in the real world.
- Memento-Skills is more about getting an agent to learn from the real world.

### Shared Foundation

| Common Ground | Memento-Skills | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skills as capability units | Yes | Yes |
| Deployable, engineerable system | Yes | Yes |
| Tool use and local execution | Yes | Yes |
| Persistent or stateful memory | Yes | Yes |

### Key Differences

| Dimension | Memento-Skills | OpenClaw |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product focus** | Focused on how an agent learns. It emphasises learning from deployment experience, reflecting on mistakes, and rewriting its own skill code and prompts. | Focused on how an assistant gets deployed and connected to the real world. |
| **Learning and evolution** | Failure triggers a read-write reflection loop: locate the failing skill, revise it, and create a new skill when needed. | Capability growth is more commonly driven by external plugins, tools, and human-provided integrations. |
| **Skill routing** | Treats retrieval and routing as core problems, especially when the skill library becomes large. | Better optimised for broad real-world integrations; context and hit-rate management depend more on the surrounding engineering setup. |
| **Skill download** | Includes a cloud catalogue plus download flow, moving toward deduped and validated reusable skills. | More open-ended ecosystem growth, with quality and duplication control relying more on platform or community processes. |
| **Skill creation** | Can create a new skill when nothing suitable exists locally or remotely, and can recreate low-utility skills instead of repeatedly using bad ones. | Missing skills are more often supplied by humans or installed explicitly. |
| **Evaluation** | Emphasises measured learning behaviour on benchmarks such as GAIA and HLE. | Emphasises assistant usability and real-world system integration. |
| **Use cases** | Hard multi-step reasoning plus daily productivity and personal life management. | Daily productivity, messaging, web tasks, devices, and real-world assistant workflows. |

In one sentence: **OpenClaw is about getting the assistant running; Memento-Skills is about getting the agent learning.**

| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [memento-s-mac-arm64.zip](https://memento-s.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/memento-s-mac-arm64.zip) |
| **Windows** (x64) | [memento-s-win-x64.zip](https://memento-s.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/memento-s-win-x64.zip) |

> After unzipping, open the app and fill in your LLM API key in the settings page. That's it — you're ready to go.

## Quick Start (Developer)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Memento-Teams/Memento-Skills.git
cd Memento-Skills
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

On first launch, `~/memento_s/config.json` is created automatically. Fill in your model profile, then start the app:

```bash
memento doctor    # Check environment, dependencies, and config validity
memento agent     # Start an interactive agent session in the terminal
memento-gui       # Launch the desktop GUI with chat interface
```

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `memento doctor` | Runs a diagnostic check on your environment — verifies Python version, installed dependencies, config file validity, and API key availability. Run this first to make sure everything is set up correctly. |
| `memento agent` | Starts an interactive agent session in the terminal. The agent can receive tasks, route to skills, execute them in a local sandbox, and reflect on results. Add `-m "..."` for single-message mode. |
| `memento-gui` | Launches the desktop GUI built with Flet, providing a visual chat interface with session management, workspace browser, slash commands, and real-time skill execution feedback. |

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration system (v2)</b></summary>

Memento-Skills uses a three-layer configuration architecture (introduced in v0.2.0):

- **System Config** (`system_config.json`) — read-only defaults shipped with the codebase.
- **User Config** (`~/memento_s/config.json`) — persistent user customisation, read-write.
- **Runtime Config** — merged at startup (System + User), used at runtime.

When the config template updates across versions, the system automatically detects and merges new fields while preserving existing user values. Fields marked with `x-managed-by: user` are protected from auto-migration.

```jsonc
{
  "llm": {
    "active_profile": "default",
    "profiles": {
      "default": {
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "your-api-key",
        "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
        "max_tokens": 8192,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "timeout": 120
      }
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-search-api-key"
  }
}
```

The `model` field uses the `provider/model` format, for example `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `openai/gpt-4o`, or `ollama/llama3`.
`TAVILY_API_KEY` is only required for web search.

The same profile system is also convenient for mainstream open-source model ecosystems, including **Kimi / Moonshot**, **MiniMax**, **GLM / Zhipu**, and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

</details>

## Built-in Skills

The built-in skills are the starting point, not the end state. The goal is not to freeze the system at ten hand-written skills, but to maintain a skill library that can keep growing, keep being retrieved, and keep being repaired.

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `filesystem` | File read, write, search, and directory operations |
| `web-search` | Tavily-based web search and page fetching |
| `image-analysis` | Image understanding, OCR, and caption-like tasks |
| `pdf` | PDF reading, form filling, merging, splitting, and OCR |
| `docx` | Word document creation and editing |
| `xlsx` | Spreadsheet processing |
| `pptx` | PowerPoint creation and editing |
| `skill-creator` | New skill creation, optimisation, and evaluation |
| `uv-pip-install` | Python dependency installation via `uv` |
| `im-platform` | IM platform integration — Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, and WeChat **(new in v0.2.0)** |

## FAQ

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Skills not found | Check the skill and workspace configuration in `~/memento_s/config.json`. |
| API timeout | Increase the active profile `timeout`. |
| Import errors | Make sure the virtual environment is active and rerun `pip install -e .`. |
| Web skill fails | Check whether `TAVILY_API_KEY` is configured and whether network access is available. |
| IM gateway connection fails | Check the IM platform credentials in `config.json`. |
| Config migration fails | Back up then manually merge `~/memento_s/config.json` with the template. |

## Chinese Summary

<details>
<summary><b>点击展开中文摘要</b></summary>

Memento-Skills 的核心不是"怎么让 assistant 跑起来"，而是"怎么让 agent 学会"。它把能力组织成 `skills`，并围绕 `Read -> Execute -> Reflect -> Write` 的闭环，让 agent 在真实任务中发现失败、定位问题 skill、修改或重建 skill，再把结果写回 skill library。

和 OpenClaw 相比，两者都具备 skills、工具调用、本地执行、持久化记忆和系统化部署能力，但关注点不同。OpenClaw 更偏向让 assistant 稳定接入真实世界；Memento-Skills 更偏向让 agent 从真实部署经验中持续学习和自我演化。

**v0.3.0 主要更新：** 新增独立的 `infra/` 基础设施层（memory / context / compact / service），将记忆、上下文、压缩等基础能力从 `core/` 中拆出，便于独立演进；新增统一的 `tools/` 工具注册中心（atomics、MCP、registry），取代原有 `builtin/tools/`；引入 Agent Profile 系统（`core/agent_profile/` + `daemon/agent_profile/`），通过后台 evolver 持续维护 agent 的长期身份与用户画像；新增 `daemon/dream/` 后台巩固循环，在会话间进行经验整理；扩展 `shared/` 共享层（fs / hooks / schema / security / tools）；新增 `utils/runtime_requirements/` 运行时依赖自动检测安装。

**v0.2.0 主要更新：** 核心架构采用 Bounded Context 重构，配置系统升级为三层隔离架构（System/User/Runtime），新增 Skill Market 支持云端技能市场，新增多平台 IM Gateway（飞书、钉钉、企业微信、微信），执行引擎拆分为细粒度子模块并增加 Tool Bridge、执行策略、错误恢复和循环检测机制，GUI 新增 Workspace 浏览器和会话管理，新增完整测试套件和构建脚本。

当前仓库已经具备比较完整的本地落地能力，包括 CLI、桌面 GUI、多平台 IM 桥接、本地 sandbox 和 skill 验证流程，因此它不仅适合 benchmark 式 agent，也适合继续往个人助理、长期运行和真实世界任务代理方向推进。
