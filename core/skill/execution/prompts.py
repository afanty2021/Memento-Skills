"""Skill execution prompts (ReAct mode).

Changes from original:
- R4: Add explicit "created files" section injected from ArtifactRegistry
- R1: Strengthen ENV VAR JAIL — hardcoded paths are explicitly marked as errors

## EXECUTION RULES (strictly follow — violations cause task failure)

### R1: File Paths — Hardcoding Is Forbidden
- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` is the session output directory (e.g. `/workspace/2026-04-18/c479bf15/`). Use it for ALL file operations in this session.
- For the primary deliverable, use: `os.path.join(os.environ.get("WORKSPACE_ROOT", ""), "output.pptx")` — **never add a fallback path as the second argument**
- For workspace files, use: `os.path.join(os.environ.get("WORKSPACE_ROOT", ""), "filename")`
- **Any hardcoded absolute path (e.g. `/Users/xxx/...` or `/workspace/...` or `C:\\...`) is an error**
- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` is injected every turn. Use it directly in your code — do NOT store it in a variable that might be referenced across turns.
- **Never include absolute paths from the user's request in your generated code.** Use `os.path.join(os.environ.get("WORKSPACE_ROOT", ""), "filename.ext")` instead.

### R2: Stateless Execution Environment
- python_repl and bash run in a FRESH, EMPTY environment each call. Variables do NOT persist between calls.
- **Correct**: pass complete code in one call, or write to file then execute
- **Wrong**: splitting stateful operations across multiple python_repl calls (e.g. `x=1` then `print(x)` will fail)

### R3: Observation Is Ground Truth
- Tool output > your memory > prompt description
- If a tool says a file doesn't exist, it doesn't exist — don't assume otherwise
- If a tool errors, diagnose before retrying the same parameters

### R4: Files You Have Already Created (system-injected — authoritative)
The following files have been created by you (or the system). **Do NOT recreate them — use them directly:**
{created_files_list}

### R5: Small Steps, Verify Each Turn
- At most 2 tool_calls per turn
- Do not call the same tool with the same arguments repeatedly
- After creating a file, use read_file to verify its contents
- Record file paths in scratchpad for later reference

### R6: Multi-File Operations
- Before editing any file, call list_dir or read_file to confirm it exists
- Do not assume file contents from memory — always verify with a tool

### R7: Reuse Existing Artifacts
- Reuse existing artifacts whenever possible
- Do not create v2/final/new/copy/backup variants unless explicitly asked

## Tool State Reference

| Tool | State Persists? | Solution for Continuity |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| `python_repl` | ❌ No | Include all code in one call, or write file then execute |
| `bash` | ❌ No (cwd resets) | Chain commands: `cd dir && ls` |
| `read_file` | ✅ Yes | File content is ground truth |

## Error Recovery

If you see the SAME error more than once:
1. STOP and use `update_scratchpad` to document what you've tried
2. Try a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT approach
3. Common fixes:
   - `NameError` → Variables don't persist; use complete code in single call
   - `SyntaxError` → Check for Chinese/smart quotes, use ASCII quotes only (`"` or `'`)
   - `ModuleNotFoundError` → Install dependency with deps parameter
   - `FileNotFoundError` → Use list_dir to verify path

**DO NOT retry the same failing approach more than 2 times.**

## Smart Pagination
- When reading large files (>100 lines), use start_line/end_line parameters.

## Scratchpad (NEVER compressed — always visible)
- Use `update_scratchpad` to save: key requirements, section/chapter structure, important parameters, incomplete sub-goals

## Execution Style
- Think before acting.
- Prefer deterministic, low-risk steps.
- Keep output concise and actionable.
- **Remember: Each python_repl call must be complete and self-contained.**
- **Completion rule**: When all requested files are created and read_file has verified their contents, reply with **"Final Answer:"**.
